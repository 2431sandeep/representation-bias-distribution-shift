- **Flexible Neural Network Architecture**: Supports customizable hidden layers, activation functions, dropout, and regularization.
- **Learning Paradigms**:
  - Independent Learning
  - Mixture Learning
  - Naive Transfer Learning
  - Super Transfer Learning
- **Metrics**: Computes RÂ², AUC, and PR AUC for model evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Generates training history plots for performance tracking.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Accepts parameters for flexible execution.
